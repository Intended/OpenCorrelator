					<li>Select and Upload datasets</li>

				</ol>
				
				<p>Currently the datasets need to be in the .csv format and be formatted correctly. The upper-left most cell should have "Years", and all cells below it should be years, without any gaps. Each additional column should be done similarly, with a title and then data below.

        The data does not need to begin or end at the same place as "years", but you should avoid having missing data in between.

        Ensure that no extranneous words or data are on the spreadsheet.
        </p>
				</br>
				<p>The closer a correlation results are to 1 or -1 indicates a strong correlation between the datasets. 1 indicates a positive correlation and -1 indicates a negative correlation.</p>
